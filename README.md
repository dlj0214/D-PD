# D-PD
We here submit our work Appendix and experimental data, our work is to diagnose depression in Parkinson's disease population, create a novel encoding and fusion scheme for homogeneous images, create a new dataset, and request access to all data. We submit our data source code of the multimodal fusion method. Our paper will be fully supplemented with our documents and experimental designs after publication.
D-PD is the main code of our program, and can use its own dataset to complete task training.Data is the main directory for the data, and the remaining data is arranged in the following format: p x d y, where p is the patient label, x is the Parkinson's disease grade, and y is the depression score. Here, we only use y as our classification and regression label.
